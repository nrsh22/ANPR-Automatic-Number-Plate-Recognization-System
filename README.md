Automatic number-plate recognition(ANPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates.
It can use existing closed-circuit television, road-rule enforcement cameras, or cameras specifically designed for the task. ANPR is used by police forces around the world for law enforcement purposes, including to check if a vehicle is registered or licensed. It is also used for electronic toll collection on pay-per-use roads and as a method of cataloguing the movements of traffic, for example by highways agencies.

## Modules Used:
  - **OpenCV** - OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common    infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
 
  - **NumPy** - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi- dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

  - **Imutils** -  Imutils are a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as   translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and
displaying Matplotlib images easier with  OpenCV and both Python 2.7 and Python 3.

  - **Tesseract-OCR** - Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images. 
Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.
